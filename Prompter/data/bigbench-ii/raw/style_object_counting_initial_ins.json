["Task Description:\nYour task is to count the total number of items mentioned in a given sentence. The sentence will describe different types of objects with some of them appearing more than once. \n\nFor example, if the sentence is \"I have a microwave, two toasters, two chairs, a couch, a fridge, an oven, a bed, a stove, two tables, and a lamp.\", the total count of items will be 13.\n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n- Pay careful attention to the quantities mentioned before each item. If no quantity is mentioned, it means there is only one of that item. \n- Do not count the types of items, count the total quantity. For example, in the sentence \"I have a microwave and two toasters.\", the total count is 3, not 2.\n- Be careful with the grammar, sometimes the quantity is implied in the noun form. For example, \"two pairs of shoes\" means 2 items, not 4. \n\nHelpful tips:\n- Read the sentence carefully, make sure you don't miss any items. \n- Count items one by one or use tally marks to keep track.\n- Double-check your answer to avoid any mistakes. \n\nAnswer Format:\nYou should provide the total count of items as a string in a JSON object like this: {\"answer\": \"13\"}.", "Task Description:\nIn this task, you will be provided with a sentence that lists several objects of different types. Your job is to count the total number of these objects and provide your answer. \n\nKeypoints for Avoiding Possible Mistakes:\n- Read the sentence carefully. Make sure to count each object listed.\n- Pay special attention to any numbers given in the sentence. For instance, if the sentence says 'five lamps', count this as five objects, not one.\n- Be careful not to count the same object twice.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n- You may find it helpful to jot down the count of each object as you read through the sentence, then add them up at the end.\n- Don't rush, take your time to read through the sentence and ensure you've counted all objects correctly.\n\nAnswer Format:\nThe answer should be provided as a number enclosed within a JSON object. For example, if your count is 15, your answer should be written as {\"answer\": \"15\"}.", "Task Description:\nYou are to read a sentence that describes a collection of items. These items might be animals, musical instruments, vegetables, or any other category. Your task is to count the total number of items mentioned in the sentence. \n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n\n1. Carefully read the sentence to identify all the items mentioned.\n2. Keep in mind that some items might be mentioned more than once. For example, \"two chickens\" means there are two items.\n3. Do not count the same item twice if it appears more than once in the sentence. However, if the item is mentioned with a different quantity, make sure to add that quantity to your total count.\n4. Remember that the task is about counting items, not types of items. For instance, if the sentence mentions 'a cat and a dog', the correct answer is '2', not '2 types of animals'.\n5. The items can be any object, not limited to a specific category.\n\nHelpful tips:\n\n1. Make a list of all the items mentioned and their respective quantities to ensure you do not miss any.\n2. Take your time and be attentive to details.\n3. If the sentence is long, you might find it helpful to read it more than once.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYou should present your answer in a JSON format. For example, if you counted 10 items in total, you should write your answer as: {\"answer\": \"10\"}.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to count the number of items mentioned in the given sentences. You need to carefully read the sentences and identify the number of each item mentioned. You need to keep in mind that there might be phrases like \"two chairs\" or \"three apples\" which imply there are multiple quantities of the same object. You should sum up all these quantities to give the final count.\n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Be careful with the sentences that include numerical words such as \"two\", \"three\", \"four\", etc. before an object, which means there are multiple quantities of that object.\n2. Avoid overcounting items. Each distinct item should be counted only once, regardless of how many times it is mentioned.\n3. Double-check your counting. Mistakes can be easily made in counting, so it is always a good idea to check your work.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n1. Read the sentence carefully and slowly to make sure you don't miss out on any item.\n2. Use a tally chart or write down the numbers for each item as you count, this will help you keep track of your counting and avoid any mistakes.\n3. The sentences might include irrelevant items that are not to be counted, so make sure you only count the ones asked for.\n\nAnswer Format:\nThe answer should be provided in the form of a dictionary with the key being \"answer\" and the value being the total count in string format. For example: {\"answer\": \"10\"} if you counted 10 items.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to count the total number of objects given in a statement. The statement will include a list of objects with some items being enumerated. Your job is to count all the objects and provide the total count. Be sure to pay attention to singular and plural objects as well as the specific quantities mentioned. \n\nKeypoints for Avoiding Possible Mistakes:\n1. Be sure to read the entire list carefully.\n2. Pay close attention to the quantities mentioned. If a quantity is specified, include that number in your total count.\n3. If an object is mentioned in the plural form but without a specific quantity, assume there is more than one but consider it as one unit for counting.\n4. Do not count objects that are not quantified. For example, if the sentence mentions \"a group of students\" without specifying the number of students, consider it as one object.\n5. If no quantity is mentioned with a singular object, count it as one.\n6. The objects may not necessarily be of the same category (e.g., they could be a mix of musical instruments, fruits, and vegetables). \n\nHelpful Tips:\n- Keep a running total as you read through the list to avoid forgetting any items.\n- For enumerated objects, add the specific number to your total count.\n- For singular objects without a quantity, simply add one to your count.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYour answer should be in the form of a JSON object. The object should have a single key-value pair. The key should be \"answer\" and the value should be the total count of objects in string format. For example, if the total count of objects is 8, your answer should be: {\"answer\": \"8\"}.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to count the number of items mentioned in a sentence. You will be given a sentence that includes a list of objects of different types. Your job is to determine how many individual objects are mentioned in the sentence. Note that when an item is mentioned with a number preceding it (e.g., \"three clarinets\"), you should count each of the items individually.\n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Be sure to count each individual item. For instance, if the sentence mentions \"three clarinets,\" this counts as three separate items, not one.\n2. Beware of items that may not be countable or relevant to the task. For instance, a sentence might mention \"a head of broccoli.\" While \"head\" is a noun, in this context it's part of the phrase \"head of broccoli,\" which describes a single item.\n3. Watch out for commas and 'and's, which often separate items in a list. Each individual item separated by these punctuation marks should be counted.\n\nHelpful tips:\n1. Make sure you understand what constitutes an individual item. This can sometimes be tricky if the sentence includes phrases like \"a pair of\" or \"a bunch of.\" In these cases, the entire phrase should typically be counted as a single item.\n2. Don't forget to include the last item in your count. It's easy to overlook this because it's often separated from the rest of the list by the word \"and.\"\n\nAnswer Format: \nYou should provide your answer in the form of a dictionary, with the key being \"answer\" and the value being the total count of items, represented as a string. \n\nFor instance:\n{\"answer\": \"2\"}", "Task Description:\nYour task is to count the number of objects mentioned in a sentence. These objects could be anything - vegetables, animals, musical instruments, etc. Remember to count each type of object only once, regardless of how many times it is mentioned. However, if a certain count of an object is mentioned explicitly (like \"two chickens\"), consider that as two separate objects.\n\nKey Points to Avoid Mistakes:\n1. Each object should be counted once unless an explicit count is mentioned. If the same object is repeated, do not count it again.\n2. Make sure to read the sentence carefully to identify all objects mentioned.\n3. Don't confuse different objects of the same category as one object. For example, a cabbage and a cauliflower are two different objects even though they both are vegetables.\n4. If an object has a quantity mentioned (like \"two chickens\"), count that as the number of objects mentioned. So, in this case, two chickens would count as two objects.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n- Reading the sentence slowly and carefully can help you ensure you don't miss any objects.\n- It might be helpful to jot down the objects as you read the sentence to help keep track of what you have counted.\n- Practice will make this task easier over time. The more you do it, the more naturally it will come to you.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYou should provide your answer in a JSON format like {\"answer\": \"count\"} where \"count\" is the number of objects you counted in the sentence. For example, if the sentence is \"I have a cat, a dog, and a bird.\" Your answer would be {\"answer\": \"3\"}.", "Task Description: \nYou will be given a sentence that includes different objects. Your task is to count the total number of objects and provide the answer.\n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n- Read the sentence carefully. The objects may not always be of the same type.\n- If a number is specified before an object (like \"two chickens\"), take that into account while counting.\n- Some objects may have descriptive phrases like \"a head of broccoli\". Don't consider \"head\" and \"broccoli\" as two separate objects. They are referring to one object.\n- Remember that the task is to count objects, not types of objects. For instance, if there are \"two chickens\", that counts as two objects, not one.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n- It may help to list out the objects on a piece of paper or in a separate document as you read the sentence. This can make it easier to count the total number of objects.\n- Some sentences may have a lot of objects. Don't rush, take your time to make sure you count all the objects.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYou should provide the total count of objects in the following format: {\"answer\": \"count\"} where 'count' is the total number of objects. For example, if there are 6 objects, you should provide the answer as {\"answer\": \"6\"}.", "Task Description:\nYou are given a statement where various objects are mentioned. The objects can be of different types like fruits, vegetables, musical instruments, etc. Your task is to count the total number of objects mentioned in the statement and provide the count as the answer.\n\nKeypoints for Avoiding Possible Mistakes:\n- Make sure to count all objects mentioned, not just unique ones. For instance, if the statement is \"I have a grape, and two bananas.\", the count should be 3.\n- Be careful about language nuances. Sometimes a singular noun can actually refer to multiple items. For instance, 'a pair of shoes' actually refers to two items - a left shoe and a right shoe.\n- Don't make assumptions or add objects not mentioned in the text. Your count should be based solely on the provided statement.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n- It may help to read the statement carefully and underline or note down each object as you read. This way you won't miss out on any object while counting.\n- Pay close attention to numbers mentioned before objects. If the statement says 'two bananas', that means there are two objects - each banana is considered an object.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYou should provide your answer as a string in a JSON format. For example, if the count of objects is 2, you should write your answer as {\"answer\": \"2\"}.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to count the number of different objects mentioned in a sentence. These objects can be of any type - they could be fruits, vegetables, musical instruments, etc. Your job is to read the sentence carefully and provide the count of the objects.\n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Be sure to carefully read the entire sentence. Some sentences may be longer and more complex than others.\n2. The count is based on the type of object, not the quantity of each object. For example, in the sentence \"I have a grape, and two bananas\", the count should be 3, not 2, because there are three different objects (a grape, a banana, and another banana).\n3. In some sentences, the same object may be referred to in different ways. For example, a head of lettuce and a lettuce head are the same object.\n4. Be careful with sentences that have multiple conjunctions like 'and'. Each clause separated by 'and' may have a different object.\n\nHelpful tips:\n1. Keep a tally of each object as you read through the sentence. This can help ensure that you don't miss any objects.\n2. If you're unsure about whether two objects are the same or different, consider looking them up. For example, a violin and a fiddle are actually the same object, while a flute and a clarinet are different.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYour answer should be a string of the format {\"answer\": \"X\"}, where X is the total count of objects."]
