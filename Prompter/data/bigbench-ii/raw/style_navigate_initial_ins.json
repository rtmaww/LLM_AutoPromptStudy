["Task Description:\nIn this task, you will be given a series of navigation instructions. You need to analyze these instructions and determine whether following these steps will lead back to the starting point. \n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n- Be sure to consider the direction faced at the start and how it changes with each turn or step. \n- Take into account the instructions \"forward\", \"backward\", \"left\", and \"right\". Remember that these directions are relative to the current facing direction.\n- If any instruction mentions \"turn around\", remember that it means to turn 180 degrees, or in other words, to face the opposite direction. \n\nHelpful Tips:\n- It might be useful to visualize the movement on a grid or draw a diagram to better understand the instructions.\n- For each step, try to keep track of the current position and direction faced.\n- Be mindful of the difference between moving sideways (left or right) and moving forward or backward.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYou should answer in the format: {\"answer\": \"A\"} or {\"answer\": \"B\"}, where \"A\" means True (you will end up at the starting point) and \"B\" means False (you will not end up at the starting point).", "Task Description:\nYour task is to analyze a set of navigation instructions, and determine whether or not following these instructions would lead you back to the starting point. The instructions will contain directives such as \"Take X steps forward/backward/right/left\" or \"Turn around\". \n\nKeypoints for Avoiding Possible Mistakes:\n- Keep track of the directions and the number of steps taken in each direction.\n- Remember that \"forward\" and \"backward\" are opposite directions, as are \"right\" and \"left\". Thus, an equal number of steps in opposite directions cancel each other out.\n- \"Turn around\" implies a 180-degree turn, so the direction opposite to the current one becomes the new forward.\n- Do not assume that a series of turns will lead back to the starting point. You must consider the steps taken after each turn.\n- Carefully read the choices. The answer should be either \"True\" (you will end up back at the starting point) or \"False\" (you will not end up back at the starting point).\n\nHelpful Tips:\n- It might be helpful to visualize or draw out the path based on the instructions.\n- When the instruction is to \"Turn around\", remember that forward becomes backward and vice versa, right becomes left and vice versa.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYour answer should be in a JSON format. For instance, if you think that you will end up at the starting point, your answer should be {\"answer\": \"A\"}. If you think you will not end up at the starting point, your answer should be {\"answer\": \"B\"}.", "Task Description:\nIn this task, you are given a series of navigation instructions such as 'Take 10 steps left' or 'Take 5 steps forward'. Your job is to determine whether these instructions would lead a person back to their starting point. \n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Keep in mind the direction in which one is facing. Instructions are given assuming the person is always facing forward.\n2. Understand the meaning of each direction. Forward means moving straight ahead, backward means moving in the opposite direction, left means moving to the left side, and right means moving to the right side.\n3. Remember that moving left and then right (or vice versa) by the same number of steps will result in the person being back at the same point along the horizontal axis. Similarly, moving forward and then backward (or vice versa) by the same number of steps will result in the person being back at the same point along the vertical axis. \n\nHelpful Tips:\n1. You may want to draw a diagram to help you visualize the movement based on the given instructions. This can help you understand whether the person ends up at the starting point.\n2. Break down the problem: First, analyze the horizontal movement (left and right) and then the vertical movement (forward and backward). If in both cases the person returns to the initial point, then the answer is true.\n\nAnswer Format:\nAfter analyzing the given instructions, if the person ends up at the starting point, your answer should be {\"answer\": \"A\"}. If the person does not end up at the starting point, your answer should be {\"answer\": \"B\"}.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to read a series of navigation instructions. These instructions are all based on the assumption that you always face forward. Using these instructions, you need to determine whether one would end up back at the starting point after following all of the given steps. \n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n- Make sure you understand the directions: Right and left are based on the forward direction, backward is opposite to the forward direction.\n- Count the steps carefully. You need to calculate if the steps taken in opposite directions cancel each other out or not.\n- Remember that moving left or right doesn't change your position along the forward-backward axis, and vice versa. \n\nHelpful tips:\n- You might find it helpful to draw a diagram or use a piece of paper to visually track the steps.\n- Keep in mind that \"back at the starting point\" means that you end up exactly where you started, not just close to it.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYou will be provided with two choices: A. True, B. False. You should choose \"True\" if you end up back at the starting point and \"False\" if you don't. The answer should be written in a JSON format like this: {\"answer\": \"A\"} or {\"answer\": \"B\"}.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to determine if one would end up back at the starting point given a series of navigation instructions. The instructions include directions such as forward, backward, left, right, turn around, etc., and steps to be taken in those directions. \n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Carefully interpret the navigation instructions. Pay special attention to the steps and their direction.\n2. Keep track of every movement, particularly when the instructions involve turning around or changing direction.\n3. Be aware that \"turn around\" means to turn 180 degrees and face the opposite direction. Similarly, \"turn right\" or \"turn left\" means to turn 90 degrees in the respective direction.\n4. Understand that if one is facing forward, then a step right is not the same as turning right and taking a step. This is also applicable for left steps.\n\nHelpful tips:\n1. Visualizing the movements can be really helpful in determining the end position. You can use a grid or coordinate system to keep track of the steps.\n2. Instructions like 'Always face forward' mean that the orientation is not changed during the journey, and steps right or left are taken sideways.\n\nAnswer Format:\nAfter analyzing the navigation instructions, select the correct answer from the provided choices: 'True' if one would end up back at the starting point, or 'False' if one would end up at a different point. Your response should be in JSON format, like this: \n{\"answer\": \"A\"} for True or {\"answer\": \"B\"} for False.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to analyze a set of navigation instructions and determine whether following those instructions would lead one back to the original starting point. The instructions will include directional commands such as 'Turn around', 'Take x steps', 'Turn left', 'Turn right', 'Always face forward', etc. \n\nKeypoints for Avoiding Possible Mistakes:\n1. Understand the directions: 'Turn around' means to turn 180 degrees, 'Take x steps' means to move forward x steps, 'Turn left' and 'Turn right' are self-explanatory.\n2. Keep track of the movements: Remember to note every movement as it affects the final position. A step forward followed by a step backward brings you back to the original position, but a step left followed by a step right moves you to a new position.\n3. Consider the direction faced: 'Always face forward' means the person doesn't turn, so 'Take x steps right' or 'left' does not change the direction faced, but changes the position.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n- Visualize the instructions. It may help to draw a diagram of the movements.\n- Keep a count of steps in each direction. If the total steps in opposite directions are equal, you end up at the start.\n\nAnswer Format:\nAfter analyzing the instructions, if one ends up back at the starting point, select option 'A'. If one does not end up at the starting point, select option 'B'. Your answer should be in the following format: \n{\"answer\": \"A\"} for True and {\"answer\": \"B\"} for False.", "Task Description:\nThis task requires you to read a series of navigation instructions and determine whether one would end up back at the starting point. Your answer should be based on the assumption that the person executing the instructions starts at a certain point and follows the given steps accurately. You should not consider any external factors like obstacles or changes in direction not mentioned in the instructions.\n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Pay close attention to the direction and number of steps given in the instruction.\n2. Remember that \"turn around\" means to turn 180 degrees, so any steps taken after this instruction would be in the opposite direction to the steps taken before it.\n3. If the instructions say \"always face forward\", it implies that the direction does not change regardless of the steps taken.\n4. \"Turn left\" or \"turn right\" should be considered as a 90 degree turn from the current facing direction. Two consecutive \"turn left\" or \"turn right\" instructions will make the person face the opposite direction.\n\nHelpful tips:\n1. Visualize the movement based on the instructions. You might find it helpful to draw a diagram or use objects to represent the steps and direction changes.\n2. Keep track of the direction and number of steps taken to ensure accurate calculations.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYour answer should be in the form of a JSON object. For example:\n{\"answer\": \"A\"} if the person ends up back at the starting point or {\"answer\": \"B\"} if the person does not end up back at the starting point.\n\nRemember, the available choices are: \nA. True - the person ends up back at the starting point \nB. False - the person does not end up back at the starting point", "Task Description:\nIn this task, you will be given a series of navigation instructions, like taking a certain number of steps in a certain direction or turning around. Your task is to determine whether, following these instructions, one would end up back at the starting point or not. \n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Pay attention to the direction of the steps, not just the number of steps taken. \n2. Remember that \"Turn around\" means to go in the opposite direction, and \"Always face forward\" means all steps are taken in the initial direction.\n3. Keep in mind that taking equal steps in opposite directions would make you end up at the starting point.\n4. \"Turn left\" or \"Turn right\" doesn't have any impact unless followed by a step instruction.\n\nHelpful tips:\n1. You can visualize the navigation on a piece of paper, drawing a line for each step taken.\n2. Turning around twice is equivalent to facing the original direction.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYour answer should be in the form of a JSON object with the key as \"answer\" and value as either \"A\" (representing True, that one would end up back at the starting point) or \"B\" (representing False, that one would not end up back at the starting point).\n\nFor example:\nIf you think the instructions would lead back to the starting point, your answer would be {\"answer\": \"A\"}. \nIf you think the instructions would not lead back to the starting point, your answer would be {\"answer\": \"B\"}.", "Task Description:\nYour task is to analyze a series of navigation instructions and determine whether the given path would lead back to the starting point. These instructions could include taking steps forward or backward, turning right or left, or even turning around. \n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Be sure to pay attention to the sequence of instructions. The order of steps can significantly impact the result.\n2. Note that \"turning around\" means a 180-degree turn and changes the direction to the opposite. For instance, if you are moving forward and then turn around, you will be moving backward. Similarly, a turn to the right followed by another turn to the right will make you face the opposite direction.\n3. \"Taking steps right\" or \"taking steps left\" should be interpreted as moving sideways to the right or left, not as turning right or left.\n4. The term \"Always face forward\" should not be confused with the direction. It simply implies that there is no change in the direction of the face.\n\nHelpful tips:\n1. To simplify the process, you can visualize the instructions on a graph with the starting point being the origin.\n2. Be mindful of the number of steps taken. In many cases, returning to the start would require an equal number of steps in opposite directions.\n\nAnswer Format:\nAfter analyzing the instructions, choose the correct answer from the choices given. Your answer should be in the form of a dictionary with \"answer\" as the key and the selected choice as the value. For example: {\"answer\": \"A\"} or {\"answer\": \"B\"}.", "Task Description:\nThis task involves a series of navigation instructions and your goal is to determine whether following these instructions would lead you back to the original starting point. The instructions can involve steps in any direction and any number of turns.\n\nKeypoints for avoiding possible mistakes:\n1. Read all the instructions carefully. Remember that a 'turn around' means to turn 180 degrees and face the opposite direction.\n2. Pay close attention to the direction (right, left, forward, backward) of the steps and the number of steps.\n3. Keep track of the turns and steps. For example, a right turn followed by a right turn would leave you facing the opposite direction.\n\nHelpful Tips:\n1. It may be helpful to visualize the instructions as a path on a grid. For instance, taking 'x' steps to the right could be visualized as moving 'x' spaces to the right on a grid.\n2. Be aware of the different directions. A step to the right is not the same as a turn to the right. \n3. 'Turn around' means to face the opposite direction. If you were facing north, you would now be facing south. If you were facing east, you would now be facing west.\n\nAnswer Format:\nYou should provide your answer in the form of an object, like so: {\"answer\": \"A\"} or {\"answer\": \"B\"}. Answer \"A\" represents True - you would end up back at the starting point. Answer \"B\" represents False - you would not end up back at the starting point."]
