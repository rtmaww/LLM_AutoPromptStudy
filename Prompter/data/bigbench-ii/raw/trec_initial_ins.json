    "In this task, you are given a question and a set of choices labeled from A to F. Each choice represents a category: A for Abbreviation (ABBR), B for Entity (ENTY), C for Description and abstract concept (DESC), D for Human being (HUM), E for Location (LOC), and F for Numeric value (NUM). Your job is to identify the category that the question is asking for and provide the label as your answer.\n\nAnswer Format: The answer should be provided in a JSON format with \"answer\" as the key and the label of the correct choice as the value, formatted as a single uppercase letter between double quotes. For example, if the correct category is 'Entity', the answer should be formatted as: {\"answer\": \"B\"}",
    "In this task, you are given a question and a list of possible categories that the question might fall into. The categories are abbreviation, entity, description and abstract concept, human being, location, and numeric value, coded as ABBR, ENTY, DESC, HUM, LOC, and NUM respectively. You are required to select the category that best fits the question. \n\nYour response should be in a JSON format with the key \"answer\" and the corresponding category code as the value. For example, if the category is \"description and abstract concept\", your response should be {\"answer\": \"C\"}.",
    "For this task, you are presented with a question and a number of multi-choice answers. Each answer corresponds to a different type of question classification. You need to determine the correct classification for the given question. The classification options are:\n\nA. ABBR (Abbreviation) - The question is asking for an abbreviation or acronym.\n\nB. ENTY (Entity) - The question is asking for an entity, which could be any named object, creature, phenomena, or concept.\n\nC. DESC (Description and abstract concept) - The question is asking for a description or abstract concept, such as an explanation, definition or reason.\n\nD. HUM (Human being) - The question is asking for a person or group of people.\n\nE. LOC (Location) - The question is asking for a location or geographical entity.\n\nF. NUM (Numeric value) - The question is asking for a numerical value.\n\nYour answer should be in the following format: {\"answer\": \"X\"} where \"X\" is the letter corresponding to the correct classification.",
    "The task involves classifying the type of answer that is expected from a given question. Categories include ABBR (Abbreviation), ENTY (Entity), DESC (Description and abstract concept), HUM (Human being), LOC (Location), and NUM (Numeric value). Your job is to read the question, analyze what type of answer it needs, and select the corresponding code from the provided choices. \n\nThe expected answer format is a JSON object containing the key \"answer\" and its value being the code of the selected category in the form of a string. For example, if you think the answer to the question is a numeric value, your response should be {\"answer\": \"F\"}.",
    "In this task, you will be provided with a question and several choices. Your task is to categorize the type of question. The categories are: ABBR (Abbreviation), ENTY (Entity), DESC (Description and abstract concept), HUM (Human being), LOC (Location), and NUM (Numeric value). After analyzing the question, select the corresponding category from the provided choices.\n\nPlease provide the answer in the form of a JSON object. The answer key should be \"answer\", and the value should be the letter corresponding to the correct choice, enclosed in double quotes. For example: {\"answer\": \"A\"} if the correct category is ABBR (Abbreviation).",
    "In this task, you are given a question and a set of choices that represent the category to which the question belongs. You need to determine the category of the question from the provided choices. The categories are as follows: \n\nA. ABBR (Abbreviation)\nB. ENTY (Entity)\nC. DESC (Description and abstract concept)\nD. HUM (Human being)\nE. LOC (Location)\nF. NUM (Numeric value)\n\nYour answer should be in the format of a JSON object, where \"answer\" is the key and the corresponding chosen category letter is the value. For example, if you think the question falls under the category of 'Description and abstract concept', your answer should be {\"answer\": \"C\"}.",
    "This task requires you to classify a question based on its main focus. Please read the question carefully and choose the best category from the following choices. \n\nChoices: \n- A. ABBR (Abbreviation): If the question is about an abbreviation or acronym.\n- B. ENTY (Entity): If the question is about a specific entity such as a person, place, organization, or thing.\n- C. DESC (Description and abstract concept): If the question is asking for a description or explanation of a concept.\n- D. HUM (Human being): If the question is about a specific human being or a specific characteristic of a person.\n- E. LOC (Location): If the question is about a specific location.\n- F. NUM (Numeric value): If the question is about a specific numerical value.\n\nProvide your answer in the following format: {\"answer\": \"Choice letter\"} \n\nFor example, if you think the focus of the question is about an entity, your response should be {\"answer\": \"B\"}",
    "For this task, you are given a question and a list of categories like 'ABBREVIATION', 'ENTITY', 'DESCRIPTION', 'HUMAN', 'LOCATION', and 'NUMERIC VALUE'. Your job is to determine which category best fits the given question. \n\nFor example, if the question is about the location of a specific place, your answer would be 'LOCATION'. If the question is asking about a definition or explaining a concept, your answer would be 'DESCRIPTION'. \n\nFor each input, your answer should be in the following format: `{\"answer\": \"<CORRESPONDING LETTER>\"}`. For instance, if the correct category is 'LOCATION', and 'LOCATION' corresponds to 'E' in the choices, your answer should be `{\"answer\": \"E\"}`. \n\nDifferent letters may correspond to different categories in different questions. Always refer to the provided options in each individual question.",
    "For this task, you are provided with a question and multiple choice answers indicating different types of information. Your job is to classify the question according to the type of answer it requires. The options include:\n\nA. ABBR (Abbreviation) \nB. ENTY (Entity) \nC. DESC (Description and abstract concept)\nD. HUM (Human being)\nE. LOC (Location)\nF. NUM (Numeric value)\n\nBased on the question, choose the best suited option. For example, if the question is about a person, the correct choice will be 'D. HUM (Human being)'. If the question asks for a numerical value, the correct choice will be 'F. NUM (Numeric value)'.\n\nThe answer should be formatted as a JSON object with the key as \"answer\" and the value as the letter associated with the correct choice. For example, if the correct answer is 'B. ENTY (Entity)', your response should be: {\"answer\": \"B\"}",
    "Please read the following question carefully. After reading the question, identify the category to which the answer to the question belongs. The possible categories are indicated on the 'Choices' list:\nA. ABBR (Abbreviation)\nB. ENTY (Entity)\nC. DESC (Description and abstract concept)\nD. HUM (Human being)\nE. LOC (Location)\nF. NUM (Numeric value)\n\nBased on your analysis, determine the best category that the answer to the question would belong. Your answer must be formatted as a JSON object that indicates the answer key. It should look like this: {\"answer\": \"C\"}, with the letter representing the category chosen."
