["The task involves interpreting sentences describing a list of objects, where some objects may be listed with quantities. The model's task is to count the total number of objects, taking into account the quantities mentioned. The answer should be formatted as a dictionary with a single key \"answer\" and its value as the total count of objects represented as a string.", "The task involves counting the total number of items mentioned in a sentence. These items could be anything, from animals to musical instruments to furniture, and may include specified quantities. For example, if the sentence mentions \"two chairs\", it should be counted as two items. Once all the items are counted, the total count should be provided as the answer, formatted as a JSON object with the key \"answer\". The value of \"answer\" should be a string of the total count. For example, if the total count is 10, the output should be {\"answer\": \"10\"}.", "The task involves counting the total number of items in a given list. The list will include different objects and sometimes specific quantities for certain objects. The model should add up all the items, including those with specified quantities, to find the total count. The answer should be provided in the format {\"answer\": \"total_count\"}, where total_count is the final count of all items.", "The task requires the model to count the total number of objects mentioned in the provided text. The objects could be of different types and there may be multiple objects of the same type. The model needs to carefully account for these quantities to come up with the total count. The answer should be given in a JSON format, for example: {\"answer\": \"2\"}.", "The task involves reading a list of items and counting them. The list will include different types of objects and may contain multiple objects of the same type, denoted by a number before the object (e.g., two toasters). The objects in the list are separated by commas and are usually mentioned only once, except for objects which are indicated to be more than one by a number. The objective is to count all the objects in the list and provide the total count. The answer should be returned in a JSON format with the key as \"answer\" and the total count as the value, enclosed in quotes. For example, if the total count is 10, the output should be {\"answer\": \"10\"}.", "The task requires you to count the total number of objects mentioned in the given input. You should consider each unique mention of an object as a single item, while for mentions of multiple items of the same type, you should count each individual item. For example, if it says \"two chairs\", that would count as two objects. After counting, provide the total number as a string in the format: {\"answer\": \"number\"}.", "In this task, you are to count the total number of objects mentioned in the input text. The objects can be of any type, like animals, vegetables, musical instruments, furniture, etc. In the counting, you should also consider the numeric quantities mentioned before the objects. For instance, if the input says \"two chairs\", you count it as two objects, not one. After counting, format your answer in a JSON object, with the key being \"answer\" and the value being the count, in quotation marks.", "The task requires you to count the total number of items mentioned in the input text. The text will list a variety of items along with their quantities. If a quantity is not explicitly mentioned for an item, assume there is one of that item. The count should include all items regardless of their types. The final answer should be in a JSON format, with the key \"answer\" and the total count as the value, represented as a string.", "The task involves reading a sentence that lists different objects, including the number of each type of object if more than one. Your task is to count all the objects mentioned in the sentence, regardless of their type. The answer should be formatted as a JSON object with the key as \"answer\" and the value as the total count of all objects mentioned, represented as a string. For example, if the input is \"I have a chair, a table, and two lamps.\", the output should be {\"answer\": \"4\"}.", "The task requires you to count the total number of objects mentioned in the given input sentence. The objects may be of different types and some may be specifically mentioned in multiples (like 'two chickens'). Sum up all the individual objects and those specifically mentioned in multiples to find the total count. The answer should be written as a string in the format: {\"answer\": \"number\"} where 'number' is your calculated total count of objects."]
